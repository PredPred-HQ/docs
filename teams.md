# How the Founders Met & Collaborated

Our founding team's journey began in the vibrant online Web3 community. We first connected through various blockchain forums and Discord channels, bonded by a shared passion for decentralized technologies and their potential to transform prediction markets.

## From Virtual Connections to Community Building

What started as casual online discussions evolved into a collaborative effort to build a Web3 DAO community. Together, we grew this community to an impressive 2000 members, fostering a space for knowledge sharing, project collaborations, and collective innovation. This experience allowed us to develop strong working relationships, understand each other's strengths, and build trust through shared achievements.

## Hackathon Adventures: Testing Our Synergy

As our bond strengthened, we began participating in both online and in-person hackathons together. These competitions served as crucial testing grounds:
- We honed our ability to work under pressure and tight deadlines
- We discovered complementary skills across technical, strategic, and creative domains
- We celebrated successes and learned from challenges as a unified team
- We developed a shared problem-solving approach that would later define PredPred

## The Birth of PredPred: Turning Vision into Reality

After several successful hackathon collaborations, we recognized our collective potential to build something truly impactful. Our shared frustration with existing prediction markets, combined with our technical expertise and community-building experience, led us to the natural conclusion: we should create our own decentralized prediction market platform.

Thus, PredPred was born—not just as a project, but as the culmination of our shared journey, shared values, and shared vision for a more transparent, accessible, and fair prediction market ecosystem.

Our diverse backgrounds and the trust built through years of collaboration give us a unique advantage in tackling the complex challenges of building a decentralized prediction market platform.
